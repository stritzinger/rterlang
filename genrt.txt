loop: handle_rt: ask sched for "mayrun" etc...

states: idle, waiting
WHERE STORE scheduler, and RT state?


ecode msg: split system, exit, debug, normal -> handle_msg, handle_sys_msg...

handle_msg: try_handle_call and reply


TODO:
* What are system messages?
* get Scheduler via Options
* Create Supervisor
* Add priority during init
* Think about supervisor priority
* Have other entry via enter_loop in mind!
