# scheduler gen_server with MAX priority
* mayrun(deadline): can taskx run? yes: run, no: add to waitlist
* done: taskx is done; run_next
* run_next -> if a deadline missed cast overload


WORKS ONLY WITH 1 SCHEDULER THREAD BC of Workstealing:
      Other cores / schedulers only look for work when they are idle, multiple MAX processes don't run in parallel

rttask
via (callbacks)
prio max
receive:
  {okrun, msg} -> prio MAX, run_callback()
  overload -> 
  msg -> schedmayrun, deadline, msg)

init: MAX
callbacks
Msg when State=idle
ok_run when State=waiting => HIGH
overload when State=waiting

IDEA: Create "Proxy Module" -> rename callbacks from gen_server, add some functionality -> known callbacks handle_overload, holdback/forward msg

Plain Server?!? -> We need some kind of "protocol" anyway. Easiest with gen_server behaviour

THEN: Move everything to the core of gen_server


run_callback() ->
.... if dl miss -> restart
prio_HIGH,
Sched ! done.
