From `release_handler` documentation:

   The  release  handler  process  is a locally registered process on each
   node. When a release is installed in a distributed system, the  release
   handler  on  each  node must be called. The release installation can be
   synchronized between nodes. From an operator view, it can  be  unsatis‐
   factory to specify each node. The aim is to install one release package
   in the system, no matter how many nodes there are.  It  is  recommended
   that  software  management functions are written that take care of this
   problem. Such a function can have knowledge of the system architecture,
   so  it can contact each individual release handler to install the pack‐
   age.

=== TODO ===

Is there any software available which simplifies this?

. `sendfile`
. Talk to remote `relase_handler` via `rpc`
. Integrate into `rebar3_grisp` or create another `rebar3` plugin
